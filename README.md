## Activity Goals
- Gain proficiency in writing and formatting Markdown documents.
- Understand how to use basic Markdown features such as headings, lists, images, and links.

## Learning Outcomes
These assignment learning outcomes contribute to the following course learning outcomes described in the course syllabus:

1. Describe and explain processes such as software installation or design for a variety of technical and non-technical audiences ranging from inexperienced to expert.
2. Use professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems to compose, edit, and deploy well-structured, web-ready documents and industry-standard documentation tools.
3. Identify and apply appropriate conventions of a variety of technical communities, tools, and computer languages to produce industry-consistent diagrams, summaries, and descriptions of technical topics or processes.

## Instructions
1. Recreate the content and format from the provided `writing/example.pdf` using Markdown in `writing/myclass.md`. Ensure that your Markdown file replicates the formatting (headings, lists, images, etc.) as closely as possible to match the original document.

## Deliverables
Please submit your work by pushing it to your GitHub Classroom repository.
